            <h3>Digital Steganography</h3>
            <p>In this project, we propose to develop a system to hiding data by using "STEGANOGRAPHY" technique as I used many methods stands on some techniques to have at the back-end software for hiding data based on hiding algorithms. After studying the data hiding algorithms we found many ways to hiding data by using the multimedia files and the main question for me was "Where hidden data hides?" as we found by our search to know where the data hides it's important to know what is the file type of the data that it shall be hidden and the cover file type so it is possible to alter graphic or sound files slightly without losing their overall viability for the viewer and listener. With audio, you can use bits of file that contain sound not audible to the human ear. With graphic images, you can remove redundant bits of color from the image and still produce a picture that looks intact to human eye and is difficult to discern from its original. It is in those bits that stego hides its data. By the final of our research we developed a software uses an algorithm, to embed data in an image; The purposed system is called "Steganography", the aim of this project is to encrypt the data; the meaning of encrypt is to hide the data over an image using different steganographic algorithms, in this system LSB is the algorithms that we use to hiding the data.</p>
<p>In today’s dynamic and information rich environment, information systems have become vital for any organization to survive. With the increase in the dependence of the organization on the information system, there exists an opportunity for the competitive organizations and disruptive forces to gain access to other organizations information system. This hostile environment makes information systems security issues critical to an organization. Current information security literature either focuses on unreliable information by describing the information security attacks taking place in the world or it comprises of the technical literature describing the types of security threats and the possible security systems.</p>
<p>The system deals with security during transmission of data. Commonly used technologies are Cryptography. This system deals with implementing security using Steganography. In this the end user identifies an image, which is going to act as the carrier of data. The data file is also selected and then to achieve greater speed of transmission the data file and image file are compressed and sent. Prior to this the data is embedded into the image and then sent.
